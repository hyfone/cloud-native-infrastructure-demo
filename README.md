# Cloud Native Infrastructure

### Representing infrastructure

Various ways of representing and mutating infrastructure.

#### Infrastructure as a diagram

Using a technical diagram to share intended infrastructure topologies with other humans. [More information](/1-as-diagram/README.md)

#### Infrastructure as a script

Using a uni-directional script to mutate infrastructure topologies and using the script as a way to mutate infrastructure. [More information](/2-as-script/README.md)

#### Infrastructure as code

Using standardized templating to represent infrastructure. The templating can be interpolated, and contain logic. [More information](/3-as-code/README.md)

#### Infrastructure as software

Infrastructure is managed by a residual piece of software over time. In order to mutate infrastructure, the software must be running. [More information](/4-as-software)
